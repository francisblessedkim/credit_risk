
# Credit Risk Modeling: Can We Predict Loan Defaults Before They Happen?

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores one of the most critical challenges in finance and fintech: **loan defaults**. Financial institutions face billions in losses every year due to borrowers failing to repay their loans. Striking the right balance between lending responsibly and expanding financial inclusion is an ongoing challenge.  

The guiding question for this project is simple yet powerful:  
👉 *Can I predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting before the loan is approved?*  

By following the data science lifecycle, I aim to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that not only predicts defaults but also provides interpretable insights that credit officers can trust.

## 🔄 Data Science Lifecycle

### 1. Business Understanding ✅
Loan defaults reduce profitability, increase risk exposure, and limit financial inclusion. The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that identifies high-risk borrowers while minimizing unfair rejection of low-risk applicants. Success will be measured both by **model performance** (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC) and by **business impact** (balanced risk management).

### 2. Analytic Approach ✅
This is framed as a **binary classification problem** with two outcomes: *default* or *no default*. Because the costs of errors are asymmetric, accuracy alone is not enough. Evaluation will focus on Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.  

I will begin with **Logistic Regression** for interpretability, then extend to **ensemble methods** such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM). Interpretability techniques like **feature importance** and **SHAP values** will ensure transparency in model predictions.  

### 3. Data Requirements (Next)  
I will identify the borrower and loan attributes required to build an effective model (e.g., income, employment stability, loan amount, repayment history), and assess what is realistically available in open datasets.
